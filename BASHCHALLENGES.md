*6.( a.) Go to directory d and rename “file3” to “file0”*

*( b.) Stay in the same directory and move “file0” to directory a*

**Approach**:
The path of directory d is /home/admin/a/c/d. so first i used 'cd a' command to go to directory a. then 'cd c' to go to directory c. then used 'cd d' command to go to directory d. i used 'mv file3 file0' command to rename the file file3 to file0. I used 'cd' command to return to my current directory. inorder to move files from different directory we use paths of both the files and directories. the path of file 0 is home/swathi/a/c/d and the path of directory a is home/swathi/a. Then i used 'mv home/admin/a/c/d home/admin/a' to move file0 to directory a.

*(b.) Do the same with python script (Hint : request library)*

**Approach:**
*Python script:*
First i imported request and os module from python library. Then i used a download_image function to download the logo using url. Then i used try-except to handle the exceptions that occur during execution. 'response=requests.get(url) was used to send a GET request to 'https://blog.bi0s.in/' and the response is stored in the variable 'response'. 'response.raise_for_status()' provides a convenient way to raise an exception if the request was not successful.Then i used a 'with block' with open function to open the image. Then i assigned a variable named 'save_path' which allows the user to input the path of the downloaded logo. 'wb' was used for writing binary data. since we are working on images, the content should be preserved exactly as it is without any character encoding transformations.Then i used file.write(response.content) for writing the binary content of the HTTP response to the opened file. i used 'print(f"Image downloaded successfully to {save_path}")' to show that the logo was downloaded successfully withput amy exceptions while execution. The except block handles the errors that occur during execution and i used 'print(f"Error downloading image: {e}")' to show the error during execution. Then i used 'if __name =="__main__":' to run the script as the main program. the two variables image_url and save_path prompts the user to enter the image URL and the path where they want to save the image respectively. 'download_image(image_url,save_path)' was used to call the function.

**Terminal:**
I used 'python3 download_image.py' command for the execution of the python script. I gave 'https://blog.bi0s.in/assets/logo.png' as the URL to download and saved the image as 'logo.jpg' format. The logo was succesfully downloaded without any error.

*12.Start a web server on port 8080 with python command (In any directory and access the files in web browser )*

**Approach:**
i used 'python3 -m http.server 8080' to start the web server. The server was succesfully established. Then i searched 'http.server 8080' in web browser to access the files.
**A window named 'directory listing for /' appeared which contain files in the home directory.**

*( b.) Go to https://tryhackme.com/room/furthernmap and get ip address and Scan the ip address with (-sS,-sV,-A) in your terminal include all ports*
(Hint : start machine )

**Approach:**

*Establishing VPN connection:*
First i visited https://tryhackme.com/room/furthernmap and chose task1-deploy. Then started the machine. Chose 'use a vpn' option, which redirected me to another window from where i downloaded my  configuration file according to my region. Opened my terminal to establish vpn connection. 'sudo apt-get install openvpn' command was used to install OpenVPN client in my system. Then i used 'sudo openvpn vpnconfig.ovpn' to start the OpenVPN connection. It showed 'Initialisation Sequence completed' which indicates that the vpn is successfully connected.

*Scanning the ip address:*

*nmap -sS scan:*
I used 'sudo nmap -sS -Pn 10.10.84.171' command which gives root privileges to run the scan.The output was nmap report of external ip

*Scan report:*
[nmap -sS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T68BL9NIfCVOd7gWIHq_K_w05QQj_9Qn/view)

*nmap -sV scan:*

[nmap -A](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PkkGFKsITiJANeBhWhSTqr2gnWHXPsBH/view)

**Challenges faced while solving:**
Initilally i faced difficulty in establishing vpn connection which was solved after using different vpn server. Then i couldnt perform '-sS' scan and it gave me an error stated 'You requested a scan type which requires root privileges'. I solved this issue by enabling root privileges by using 'sudo' command.


*14.( a.) Create a chat application using nc on your local machine with one terminal as server and other as the client*

*( b.) Transfer a file from server to client (save that file with another name) and display the file.*

**Approach:**

i used individual terminal for server and client.'nc -l -p 1234' command was used to create server and 'nc localhost 1234' was used to create client. Server and client connection was established. Then i ended the server and client connection by using ctrl+C in both the terminals. I used 'echo "i love java" > rs1.txt' to add "i love java" to rs1.txt file. Then i used 'nc -l -p 1234 < rs1.txt' to establish server and to transfer the file rs1.txt to client. 'nc localhost 1234 > rs2.txt' was used to establish client and it received the file rs2.txt from the server. 'ctrl+C' used in the client terminal to end the connection. 'cat rs2.txt' command was used to display the contents of the file rs2.txt.

**Command and Output:**
