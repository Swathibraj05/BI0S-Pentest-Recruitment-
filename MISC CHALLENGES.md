# MISC CHALLENGE

## CHALLENGE - 1

**CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION**:
We were given an executable file and asked to extract the flag from the binary.

**APPROACH**:
I used "cat strings" to display the contents of the file and found a base64 encoded string. i decoded the string using online base64 decoder. "https://gist.github.com/rSrikesh/ccbccc6222e857e426e53b2c7956be0a" was the output after decoding. "file.txt" file was obtained from that website. I converted the numbers in the file to its corresponding ASCII values. It was utf 8 encoded text.

**USED ONLINE TOOL**:
[Base64 decoder](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/encode_decode/)

## CHALLENGE - 3

**CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION**:
We were given a "data.txt" file and needed to translate its contents to find the flag.

**APPROACH**:
i used an online wingding translator("https://lingojam.com/WingDing") to translate the contents of "data.txt" file. The translated text was the flag. The flag was successfully obtained from the text.

**USED ONLINE TOOL**:
i used an online tool to translate the text.

## CHALLENGE - 4

**CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION**:
We were given a file, which contained repeatedly encoded text. We were asked to crack the code from that file.

**APPROACH**:
The text was repeatedly enoced by base64 encryption. i decoded the text using "notepad++" application. I used "base64 deocde by strict" option 35 times and cracked the python script hidden in that file. I wrote a python scipt to get the flag from the cracked code. Then ran the python flag script in "vs code" application. I checked the flag by running the cracked code in python idle and entering the flag as input.i got the "correct" as the output.

**FLAG OBTAINED**:
The flag obtained from this challenge is:
flag{bd03dfff3f126aba0ae3756b464d106c}

## CHALLENGE - 5

**CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION**:
We were given a "chall.txt" file and asked to find the flag.

**APPROACH**:
The contents of the "chall.txt" file was hex encoded. I used online hex decoder and got "xdv r5yg drvg 0oL xDwA gY5R ZsC gYjN ZsQ jIlM aWdX kOp 1wA KoP YgJn" as the output.
