*(b.) Do the same with python script (Hint : request library)*

**Approach:**

*Python script:*
First i imported request and os module from python library. Then i used a download_image function to download the logo using url. Then i used try-except to handle the exceptions that occur during execution. 'response=requests.get(url) was used to send a GET request to 'https://blog.bi0s.in/' and the response is stored in the variable 'response'. 'response.raise_for_status()' provides a convenient way to raise an exception if the request was not successful.Then i used a 'with block' with open function to open the image. Then i assigned a variable named 'save_path' which allows the user to input the path of the downloaded logo. 'wb' was used for writing binary data. since we are working on images, the content should be preserved exactly as it is without any character encoding transformations.Then i used file.write(response.content) for writing the binary content of the HTTP response to the opened file. i used 'print(f"Image downloaded successfully to {save_path}")' to show that the logo was downloaded successfully withput amy exceptions while execution. The except block handles the errors that occur during execution and i used 'print(f"Error downloading image: {e}")' to show the error during execution. Then i used 'if __name =="__main__":' to run the script as the main program. the two variables image_url and save_path prompts the user to enter the image URL and the path where they want to save the image respectively. 'download_image(image_url,save_path)' was used to call the function.

**Terminal:**
I used 'python3 download_image.py' command for the execution of the python script. I gave 'https://blog.bi0s.in/assets/logo.png' as the URL to download and saved the image as 'logo.jpg' format. The logo was succesfully downloaded without any error.

## CODING CHALLENGE

**1.**
[HACKERRANK QUESTIONS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v552UAO5ypoayJeChmzjRC_NoqAxURul/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114136219732784345709&rtpof=true&sd=true)

**2) Make a one line python program to find whether the given year is leap or not.**
   
`year=int(input("enter year:"))`

`print("leap year" if ((year%4==0) or (year%100!=0) and (year%400==0)) else "it is not a leap year")`

*Challenge description:*
We were asked to make a one line python program to find whether the given year is leap or not.

*Approach:*
A leap year is divisible by 4 and 400 or a year divisble by 100 and 400. so used if-else block which satisfies this condition. if the condition satisfies, it will give "leap year" as the output. Otherwise, "it is not a leap year" as the output.


**Chat app**

*Challenge description:*
We were asked to write a chat application using socket programming which should include Symmetric key encryption, SHA-512 and HMAC.

*Approach:*

*Server side:*
In crafting the server-side script, the initial step involved importing essential modules, including socket, hashlib, hmac, and the cryptography library. The derive_key function was then created to generate a secure key using the PBKDF2-HMAC algorithm, taking a user-defined password and a salt as input. Subsequently, the aes_encrypt and aes_decrypt functions were implemented, facilitating AES encryption and decryption operations. These functions utilized the cryptography library to handle AES ciphers with ECB mode and PKCS7 padding. The authenticate function was designed to verify the integrity of received data by comparing the received HMAC with a calculated HMAC using the SHA-512 hashing algorithm. Moving on to the server initialization, the start_server function was formed to set up a server socket, bind it to a specified port, and listen for incoming connections. Within the main loop, the script continuously received data from a connected client. Data authentication using the authenticate function was the first step, followed by AES decryption of the message if authentication succeeded. After decryption, the server prompted the user for a reply, encrypted the response, and sent it back to the client along with an HMAC for integrity verification. Basic exception handling was included, primarily addressing errors during the binding of the server socket to a designated port.

*Client code:*
The derive_key function employs the PBKDF2HMAC key derivation function with SHA-512 to generate a secure key from a user-provided password and a salt, enhancing the security of the encryption process. The aes_encrypt function utilizes the AES encryption algorithm in ECB mode to encrypt a user-input message. It employs PKCS7 padding to ensure proper block alignment and protect against certain cryptographic vulnerabilities. Conversely, the aes_decrypt function decrypts the received ciphertext, ensuring the confidentiality of the transmitted messages. The authenticate function is crucial for verifying the integrity of received messages. It employs HMAC with SHA-512 to create a hash-based message authentication code, which is then compared to the received HMAC to detect any tampering or unauthorized alterations. The client function establishes a TCP connection to a specified server and continuously prompts the user for input. Each user input is encrypted using the derived key and sent to the server along with an HMAC for authentication. Upon receiving a response from the server, the client verifies the authenticity of the message using the authenticate function. If the message is deemed authentic, it is decrypted and displayed to the user; otherwise, an authentication failure message is displayed, signaling potential tampering.

**ASM LEVEL-7**

*Challenge description:*
In this level we were asked to set the upper 8 bits of the ax register to 0x42 using only one move instruction.

*Approach:*
The upper 8 bits of ax register is ah register. 'mov ah, 0x42' command was used to assign 0x42 to ah register.This assembly source code was saved as result4.asm and then changed to object code.Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result6.o result6.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result6.o result6.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution. To run the code '/challenge/run < result6.bin' was used and the flag was obtained successfully.

**ASM LEVEL-8**

*Challenge description:*
In this level we were asked to compute rax = rdi % 256, rbx = rsi % 65536 using only one move instruction.

*Approach:*
By using the math trick to optimize modulo operator, the result of x % y where y is 2^n, will be the lower n bits of x. In the operation rdi%256, 256 is 2^8 and the result will be the lower 8 bits of rdi, which is dil. They asked to set the value of dil to rax. So i used 'mov al, dil' command copy the value in dil to al.Similarly, in the operation rsi%65536, 65536 is 2^16 and the result will be the lower 16 bits of rsi, which is si. They asked to set the value of si to rax. 'mov bx, si' command was used to copy the value in si to bx.This assembly source code was saved as result7.asm and then changed to object code.Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result7.o result7.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result7.o result7.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution. To run the code '/challenge/run < result7.bin' was used and the flag was obtained successfully.

**ASM LEVEL-9**

*Challenge description:*
In this level we were asked to set rax to the 5th least significant byte of rdi using only mov, shr, shl

*Approach:*
First 'shl rdi, 24' command was used to shift rdi to the left by 24 bits. Then 'shr rdi, 56' was used to shift rdi to the right by 56 bits. Lastly 'mov rax, rdi' command was used to copy the current value of rdi to rax.This assembly source code was saved as result8.asm and then changed to object code.Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result8.o result8.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result8.o result8.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution. To run the code '/challenge/run < result8.bin' was used and the flag was obtained successfully.

**ASM LEVEL-10**

*Challenge description:*
In this level we were asked to perform 'rdi AND rsi' and set the value to rax.

*Approach:*
First 'and rax, rdi' command was used to perform bitwise AND operation between rax and rdi, and the value was stored in the rax register. Then 'and rax, rsi' command was used perform bitwise AND operation between the contents of rax and rsi registers and the result was stored in the rax register.This assembly source code was saved as result9.asm and then changed to object code.Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result9.o result9.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result9.o result9.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution. To run the code '/challenge/run < result9.bin' was used and the flag was obtained successfully.

                    return false;
                }
            }

            return true;
        }
    }
}`

*Challenge description:*
We were asked to find the flag hidden in the .class file

*Approach:*
After analysing the code, i understood that the predefined byte array 'var3' contains the ASCII values of the character corresponding to the flag. ASCII values and their corresponding characters: 75-K, 110-n, 111-o, 87-W, 95-_, 89-Y, 117-u, 82-R, 65-A, 53-5, 67-C, 49-1, 125-}. By arranging the characters in their right order, it was found to be "KnoW_YouR_A5C115}". 
So the correct password and the flag is flag{KnoW_YouR_A5C115}. The output after entering the password was "Access granted.".

*Flag found:*
The flag obtained from this .class file is:
flag{KnoW_YouR_A5C115}
