2) Make a one line python program to find whether the given year is leap or not.
   
`year=int(input("enter year:"))`

`print("leap year" if ((year%4==0) or (year%100!=0) and (year%400==0)) else "it is not a leap year")`

Challenge description:
We were asked to make a one line python program to find whether the given year is leap or not.

Approach:
A leap year is divisible by 4 and 400 or a year divisble by 100 and 400. so used if-else block which satisfies this condition.
if the condition satisfies, it will give "leap year" as the output. Otherwise, "it is not a leap year" as the output.
