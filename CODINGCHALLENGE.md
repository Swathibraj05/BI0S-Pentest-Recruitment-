**2) Make a one line python program to find whether the given year is leap or not.**
   
`year=int(input("enter year:"))`

`print("leap year" if ((year%4==0) or (year%100!=0) and (year%400==0)) else "it is not a leap year")`

*Challenge description:*
We were asked to make a one line python program to find whether the given year is leap or not.

*Approach:*
A leap year is divisible by 4 and 400 or a year divisble by 100 and 400. so used if-else block which satisfies this condition. if the condition satisfies, it will give "leap year" as the output. Otherwise, "it is not a leap year" as the output.


**Chat app**

*Challenge description:*
We were asked to write a chat application using socket programming which should include Symmetric key encryption, SHA-512 and HMAC.

*Approach:*

*Server side:*
In crafting the server-side script, the initial step involved importing essential modules, including socket, hashlib, hmac, and the cryptography library. The derive_key function was then created to generate a secure key using the PBKDF2-HMAC algorithm, taking a user-defined password and a salt as input. Subsequently, the aes_encrypt and aes_decrypt functions were implemented, facilitating AES encryption and decryption operations. These functions utilized the cryptography library to handle AES ciphers with ECB mode and PKCS7 padding. The authenticate function was designed to verify the integrity of received data by comparing the received HMAC with a calculated HMAC using the SHA-512 hashing algorithm. Moving on to the server initialization, the start_server function was formed to set up a server socket, bind it to a specified port, and listen for incoming connections. Within the main loop, the script continuously received data from a connected client. Data authentication using the authenticate function was the first step, followed by AES decryption of the message if authentication succeeded. After decryption, the server prompted the user for a reply, encrypted the response, and sent it back to the client along with an HMAC for integrity verification. Basic exception handling was included, primarily addressing errors during the binding of the server socket to a designated port.

*Client code:*
The derive_key function employs the PBKDF2HMAC key derivation function with SHA-512 to generate a secure key from a user-provided password and a salt, enhancing the security of the encryption process. The aes_encrypt function utilizes the AES encryption algorithm in ECB mode to encrypt a user-input message. It employs PKCS7 padding to ensure proper block alignment and protect against certain cryptographic vulnerabilities. Conversely, the aes_decrypt function decrypts the received ciphertext, ensuring the confidentiality of the transmitted messages. The authenticate function is crucial for verifying the integrity of received messages. It employs HMAC with SHA-512 to create a hash-based message authentication code, which is then compared to the received HMAC to detect any tampering or unauthorized alterations. The client function establishes a TCP connection to a specified server and continuously prompts the user for input. Each user input is encrypted using the derived key and sent to the server along with an HMAC for authentication. Upon receiving a response from the server, the client verifies the authenticity of the message using the authenticate function. If the message is deemed authentic, it is decrypted and displayed to the user; otherwise, an authentication failure message is displayed, signaling potential tampering.
