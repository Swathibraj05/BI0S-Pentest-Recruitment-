# REVERSING CHALLENGE

## CHALLENGE - 1

**CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION**:
In this challenge, we were asked to find the flag from the binary.

**APPROACH**:
I used "ghidra" application to disassemble the "tryme.exe" file. Then i got the source code from "main" function. I converted the C code to python for better understanding. The flag is obtained by doing XOR operation in each corresponding element of 'local_88' array with the ASCII values of characters in a secret key, which is "sup3r_s3cr3t_k3y_1337." Then i used another python script to get the flag. It converts each encrypted value and ASCII value to characters using the chr function. It utilizes the zip function to pair corresponding elements in local_88 and the ASCII values of the secret key characters. The flag was succesfully obtained.

**Flag found**:
flag{_y0u_f0und_key_}

## CHALLENGE - 2

**CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION**:
We were given a ".pyc" file and needed to decompile it to find the flag

**APPROACH**:
First i decompiled "chall.pyc" file using "https://www.toolnb.com/tools-lang-en/pyc.html". I used a python script to print the flag. The Python code takes a target string, represented by the variable "target_string", and transforms it into a new string named "correct_input". The transformation is carried out within the for loop. The ASCII value of characters at even indices are added by 3. Conversely, the ASCII value of charcters at odd indices are subtracted by 2. This process of index-based character transformation is implemented using a conditional statement that checks whether the index is even or odd. The final result, stored in "correct_input" and is then printed. The flag was successfully obtained when the program was executed.

**Used online tool**:
i used a PyC decompiler to decompile "chall.pyc" file
