# REVERSING CHALLENGE

## CHALLENGE - 1

**CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION**:
We were given an executable file and needed to disassemble to find the flag.

**APPROACH**:
I used ghidra to disassemble the "tryme.exe" file. Then i got the source code from "main" function. I converted the C code to python for better understanding. The flag is obtained by doing XOR operation in each corresponding element of 'local_88' array with the ASCII values of characters in a secret key, which is "sup3r_s3cr3t_k3y_1337." Then i used another python script to get the flag. It converts each encrypted value and ASCII value to characters using the chr function. It utilizes the zip function to pair corresponding elements in local_88 and the ASCII values of the secret key characters. The flag was succesfully obtained.

**Flag found**:
The flag obtained after solving the challenge is:
flag{_y0u_f0und_key_}

## CHALLENGE - 2

**CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION**:
We were given a ".pyc" file and needed to decompile it to find the flag

**APPROACH**:
First i decompiled "chall.pyc" file using "https://www.toolnb.com/tools-lang-en/pyc.html". I used a python script to print the flag. The Python code takes a target string, represented by the variable "target_string", and transforms it into a new string named "correct_input". The transformation is carried out within the for loop. The ASCII value of characters at even indices are added by 3. Conversely, the ASCII value of charcters at odd indices are subtracted by 2. This process of index-based character transformation is implemented using a conditional statement that checks whether the index is even or odd. The final result, stored in "correct_input" and is then printed. The flag was successfully obtained when the program was executed.

**Used online tool**:
i used a PyC decompiler to decompile "chall.pyc" file

## CHALLENGE - 3

**CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION**:
We were given an executable file and needed to decompile it to find the flag.

**APPROACH**:
I opened the "conditional.exe" file in ghidra. I analyzed the "giveflag" function of the code. Then i wrote a python script for the flag.The Python code aims to create and print a "flag" using a simple encryption technique. The flag starts as a list of 60 characters, all set to the letter 'A'. The code uses a "key" to modify each character in the flag.The main part of the code is the for loop that goes through each character in the flag. For each character, it combines the ASCII code of the character with the corresponding key value using a specific operation. This combined result is then converted back to a character and stored in the flag. The purpose is to transform the original 'A' characters into a different set of characters based on the key.The operation (key[i] + ord(flag[i])) & 0xFF ensures that the result stays within a certain range (0 to 255) by using bitwise AND. This prevents the values from going beyond the valid range for ASCII characters.After modifying all 60 characters, the code prints the final flag by joining them into a string. The result is a string that represents the encrypted or modified flag.The script was executed in the terminal. The flag was successfully obtained as the output.

**Flag found**:
The flag obtained after solving the challenge is:
flag{at_least_this_cafe_wont_leak_your_credit_card_numbers}

## CHALLENGE - 4

**CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION**:
We were given a file and needed to decompile it to find the flag.

**APPROACH**:
I used ghidra to decompile the given file. I got the source code from "main" function. We were asked to find the password of the file as well. The condition for the password was the character at the fourth index should be "@" and the password contains 10 characters too. I ran the file in terminal and gave "abcd@efghi" as the password. The flag was the same input string enclosed in flag format. The flag was successfully obtained.

**Flag found**:
The flag obtained after solving the challenge is:
flag{abcd@efghi}
