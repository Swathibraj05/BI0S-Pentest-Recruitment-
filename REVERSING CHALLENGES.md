# REVERSING CHALLENGE

## CHALLENGE - 1

**CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION**:
In this challenge, we were asked to find the flag from the binary.

**APPROACH**:
I used "ghidra" application to disassemble the "tryme.exe" file. Then i got the source code from "main" function. I converted the C code to python for better understanding. The flag is obtained by doing XOR operation in each corresponding element of 'local_88' array with the ASCII values of characters in a secret key, which is "sup3r_s3cr3t_k3y_1337." Then i used another python script to get the flag. It converts each encrypted value and ASCII value to characters using the chr function. It utilizes the zip function to pair corresponding elements in local_88 and the ASCII values of the secret key characters. The flag was succesfully obtained.

**Flag found**:
flag{_y0u_f0und_key_}
