# REVERSING CHALLENGE

**Pwn college ASM LEVEL (1-10)**

**ASM LEVEL-1**

*Challenge description:*
We were asked to set rdi = 0x1337

*Approach:*
Inorder to set rdi register value to 0x1337, i used mov command. 'mov rdi,0x1337' command was used. This assembly source code was saved as result.asm and then changed to object code.Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result.o result.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result.o result.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution. To run the code '/challenge/run < result.bin' was used and the flag was obtained successfully.

*Flag found:*
The flag found after solving level-1 is:

**ASM LEVEL-2**

*Challenge description:*
We were asked to assign values for multiple registers rax=0x1337, r12=0xCAFED00D1337BEEF, rsp=0x31337

*Approach:*
I used mov command to set values for registers. First set values for rax, then r12 and finally rsp. This assembly source code was saved as result1.asm and then changed to object code.Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result1.o result1.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result1.o result1.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution. To run the code '/challenge/run < result1.bin' was used and the flag was obtained successfully.

*Flag found:*

**ASM LEVEL-3**

*Challenge description:*
We were asked to add 0x331337 to rdi register. The value of rdi register was set to 0x227.

*Approach:*
I used 'add rdi, 0x331337' to add 0x331337 to rdi register. This command adds 0x331337 to 0x227 and the value of rdi register is changed to 0x331337+0x227. This assembly source code was saved as result2.asm and then changed to object code.Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result2.o result2.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result2.o result2.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution. To run the code '/challenge/run < result2.bin' was used and the flag was obtained successfully.

**ASM LEVEL-4**

*Challenge description:*
In this level we were asked to compute

F(x)=mx+b,where m=rdi, x=rsi, b=rdx and the result should be placed into rax. The value of rdi was set to 0xed6, rsi was set to 0x3dd, rdx was set to 0x1549. We were asked to give assembly in bytes.

*Approach:*
'imul rsi, rdi ' was used first for the multiplication of rdi and rsi. Then i used 'add rax, rsi' to add the value of rax+rsi in rax register. then i used 'addd rax, rdx' to add the value of rax + rdx in rax register.This assembly source code was saved as result3.asm and then changed to object code.Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result3.o result3.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result3.o result3.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution. To run the code '/challenge/run < result3.bin' was used and the flag was obtained successfully.

**ASM LEVEL-5**

*Challenge description:*
In this level we were given the formula,
speed=distance/time
where distance = rdi, time = rsi, speed = rax.
We were asked to perform division of rdi and rsi, and also assign the value of this operation to rax register. 

*Approach:*
First we used 'mov rax, rdi' to assign the value of rdi to rax register. Then we used 'div rsi' command to perform rax by rsi and the quotient was stored in rax.This assembly source code was saved as result4.asm and then changed to object code.Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result4.o result4.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result4.o result4.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution.

**ASM LEVEL-6**

*Challenge description:*
In this level we were asked to compute rdi % rsi and set the value in rax.

*Approach:*
First 'mov rax, rdi' command was used to copy the value of rdi to rax. Then 'div rsi' was used which divides rax by rsi and the remainder is stored in rdx.Finally,'mov rax, rdx' command was used to copy the value of the remainder stored in rdx to rax.This assembly source code was saved as result5.asm and then changed to object code.Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result5.o result5.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result5.o result5.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution. To run the code '/challenge/run < result5.bin' was used and the flag was obtained successfully.

**ASM LEVEL-7**

*Challenge description:*
In this level we were asked to set the upper 8 bits of the ax register to 0x42 using only one move instruction.

*Approach:*
The upper 8 bits of ax register is ah register. 'mov ah, 0x42' command was used to assign 0x42 to ah register.This assembly source code was saved as result4.asm and then changed to object code.Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result6.o result6.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result6.o result6.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution. To run the code '/challenge/run < result6.bin' was used and the flag was obtained successfully.

**ASM LEVEL-8**

*Challenge description:*
In this level we were asked to compute rax = rdi % 256, rbx = rsi % 65536 using only one move instruction.

*Approach:*
By using the math trick to optimize modulo operator, the result of x % y where y is 2^n, will be the lower n bits of x. In the operation rdi%256, 256 is 2^8 and the result will be the lower 8 bits of rdi, which is dil. They asked to set the value of dil to rax. So i used 'mov al, dil' command copy the value in dil to al.Similarly, in the operation rsi%65536, 65536 is 2^16 and the result will be the lower 16 bits of rsi, which is si. They asked to set the value of si to rax. 'mov bx, si' command was used to copy the value in si to bx.This assembly source code was saved as result7.asm and then changed to object code.Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result7.o result7.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result7.o result7.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution. To run the code '/challenge/run < result7.bin' was used and the flag was obtained successfully.

**ASM LEVEL-9**

*Challenge description:*
In this level we were asked to set rax to the 5th least significant byte of rdi using only mov, shr, shl

*Approach:*
First 'shl rdi, 24' command was used to shift rdi to the left by 24 bits. Then 'shr rdi, 56' was used to shift rdi to the right by 56 bits. Lastly 'mov rax, rdi' command was used to copy the current value of rdi to rax.This assembly source code was saved as result8.asm and then changed to object code.Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result8.o result8.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result8.o result8.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution. To run the code '/challenge/run < result8.bin' was used and the flag was obtained successfully.

**ASM LEVEL-10**

*Challenge description:*
In this level we were asked to perform 'rdi AND rsi' and set the value to rax.

*Approach:*
First 'and rax, rdi' command was used to perform bitwise AND operation between rax and rdi, and the value was stored in the rax register. Then 'and rax, rsi' command was used perform bitwise AND operation between the contents of rax and rsi registers and the result was stored in the rax register.This assembly source code was saved as result9.asm and then changed to object code.Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result9.o result9.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result9.o result9.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution. To run the code '/challenge/run < result9.bin' was used and the flag was obtained successfully.
