Pwn college ASM LEVEL (1-10)

ASM LEVEL-1
Challenge description:
We were asked to set rdi = 0x1337

Approach:
Inorder to set rdi register value to 0x1337, i used mov command. 'mov rdi,0x1337' command was used. The assembly source code was then changed to object code. Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result.o result.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result.o result.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution.

Flag found:
The flag found after solving level-1 is:
pwn.college{UvvS0RTyPZrMvD7un6wF9clcpeL.0FN5EDL3IjNzQzW}


ASM LEVEL-2
Challenge description:
We were asked to assign values for multiple registers
rax=0x1337
r12=0xCAFED00D1337BEEF
rsp=0x31337

Approach:
I used mov command to set values for registers. First set values for rax, then r12 and finally rsp. The assembly source code was then changed to object code. Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result1.o result1.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result1.o result1.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution.

Flag found:
The flag found from ASM level-2 is:
pwn.college{M3pgfL8HnISuwSZPnujnLAWjbg8.dBTM4MDL3IjNzQzW}

ASM LEVEL-3
Challenge description:
We were asked to add 0x331337 to rdi register. The value of rdi register was set to 0x227.

Approach:
I used 'add rdi, 0x331337' to add 0x331337 to rdi register. This command adds 0x331337 to 0x227 and the value of rdi register is changed to 0x331337+0x227. This assembly source code was saved as result2.asm and then changed to object code
Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result2.o result2.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result2.o result2.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution.

Flag found:
The flag found after solving this level is:
pwn.college{gahBXAD9sjBlp7h825X-7bmE2Gv.0VN5EDL3IjNzQzW}

ASM LEVEL-4
Challenge description:
In this level we were asked to compute
F(x)=mx+b,where m=rdi, x=rsi, b=rdx and the result should be placed into rax. The value of rdi was set to 0xed6, rsi was set to 0x3dd, rdx was set to 0x1549. We were asked to give assembly in bytes.

Approach:
'imul rsi, rdi ' was used first for the multiplication of rdi and rsi. Then i used 'add rax, rsi' to add the value of rax+rsi in rax register. then i used 'addd rax, rdx' to add the value of rax + rdx in rax register.This assembly source code was saved as result3.asm and then changed to object code.Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result3.o result3.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result3.o result3.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution. To run the code '/challenge/run < result3.bin' was used and the flag was obtained successfully.

Flag found:
the flag found from this level is:
pwn.college{MYQDT1ibtUbVDIHMNpfv781Sbu3.0lN5EDL3IjNzQzW}

ASM LEVEL-5
Challenge description:
In this level we were given the formula,
speed=distance/time
where distance = rdi, time = rsi, speed = rax.
We were asked to perform division of rdi and rsi, and also assign the value of this operation to rax register. 

Approach:
First we used 'mov rax, rdi' to assign the value of rdi to rax register. **Then we used 'xor rdx, rdx' to perfectly balance the computation.** After that we used 'div rsi' command to perform division.This assembly source code was saved as result4.asm and then changed to object code.Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result4.o result4.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result4.o result4.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution. To run the code '/challenge/run < result4.bin' was used and the flag was obtained successfully.

Flag found:
The flag found from this level is:
pwn.college{IRi6T6sh0p3o-Wl5GvPHkO8dJKN.01N5EDL3IjNzQzW}

ASM LEVEL-7
Challenge description:
In this level we were asked to set the upper 8 bits of the ax register to 0x42 using only one move instruction.

Approach:
The upper 8 bits of ax register is ah register. 'mov ah, 0x42' command was used to assign 0x42 to ah register.This assembly source code was saved as result4.asm and then changed to object code.Then it was changed to binary for execution. I used 'nasm -f elf64 -o result6.o result6.asm' to convert assembly source code to object code. Then i used 'objcopy -O binary result6.o result6.bin' to convert object code to binary code for execution. To run the code '/challenge/run < result6.bin' was used and the flag was obtained successfully.

Flag found:
The flag obtained from this level is:
pwn.college{wMluDchZyM_kZBO8Ag6rcIteY8e.dFTM4MDL3IjNzQzW}

ASM LEVEL-8
Challenge description:
In this level we were asked to compute rax = rdi % 256, rbx = rsi % 65536 using only one move instruction.
